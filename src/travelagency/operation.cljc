(ns travelagency.operation
  "OperationActor -- one coordination request = one supervised actor
  run, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The advisor
  (TravelAgencyAdvisor) is sealed into a single node (:advise); its
  proposal is ALWAYS routed through the TravelAgencyGovernor (:govern)
  and the rollout phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the
  SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today)              - `store` arg
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)              - :advisor opt
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)                 - :phase in ctx

  One graph run = one coordination request (intake -> advise -> govern
  -> decide -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop --
  each operation is auditable and checkpointed.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow: `interrupt-before
  #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the decision to a
  human operator/travel-agency manager. The approver resumes with
  `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or :rejected)."
